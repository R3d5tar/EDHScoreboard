# Known Bugs

This is a list of known bugs in the current code base.

* Update commander images search (deckbrew.io aint-working any more).
    * Name completions might be handy also... (Nice to have)
* Introduce https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#tables-responsive to be able to add more commanders and keep a clean layout on mobile. Maybe use http://jsfiddle.net/4XG7T/3/ to create a sticky player column.

* Update log language to be more slang or natural, for example:
    * Now: Applying -5 life to Adam
    * New: Adam lost 5 life
