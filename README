Browser-based EDH (Commander) scoreboard written with JS and Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/). Works entirely offline on any modern browser.

Pending improvements:
- Add "Remove Player" button
- Add "Reset Life Totals" button
- Add "Show/Hide Poison Damage" button
- Add "Show/Hide Commander Damage" button
- Use HTML5 Web Storage to remember last state

Ideas from reddit, under consideration:
- Add +/- poison for all players
- Add an "icon" for the commander, maybe based on their color identity?
- Add Mana Counters
- Add Turn Counters
