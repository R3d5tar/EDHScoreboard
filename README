Browser-based EDH (Commander) scoreboard written with JS and Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/). Works entirely offline on any modern browser.

Pending improvements:
- Add "Show/Hide Poison Damage" button
- Add "Show/Hide Commander Damage" button
- Add Footer with Copyright and Contact Info

Ideas from reddit, under consideration:
- Add a counter for the number of times the commander re-entered the battlefield
- Add a configuration to allow life going negative (when using Platinum Angel or similar effects)
- Add a configuration for maximum poison counters (for playgroups that prefer to use 15 or 20)
- Add Mana Counters
- Add Turn Counters
- Add Game Timer
