Browser-based EDH (Commander) scoreboard written with JS and Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/). Works entirely offline on any modern browser.

Pending improvements:
- Add "Show/Hide Poison Damage" button
- Add "Show/Hide Commander Damage" button
- Add Footer with Copyright and Contact Info

Ideas from reddit, under consideration:
- Add Mana Counters
- Add Turn Counters
- Add a configuration for maximum poison counters (for playgroups that prefer to use 15 or 20)
